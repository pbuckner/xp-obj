Creating Objects
================

Objects are represented in X-Plane using OBJ8 files with a specific format. (See :doc:`obj8/reference` .)

While you can create these files manually (they are text files), they are usually created
using a 3D modelling tool such as `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`_, an open source application,
and `AC3D <https://www.inivis.com>`_, a commercial application. Both are
available for Mac, PC and Linux.

Learning how to use 3D modelling tools is out-of-scope for this documentation. Suffice it to say
there are thousands of video tutorials and web pages devoted to using these tools.

Plugins allow modelling applications to export OBJ8 files, and are available for:

* AC3D `plugin <https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/ac3d-plugin/>`_
* Blender `plugin <https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/blender/>`_, and :doc:`blender/creating_blender`.
